The photochromic carpet is a large size interactive floor display that
captures visitorsâ€™ footsteps in playful prints to make an environment
into a canvas of past activities. The implementation consists of a
carpet coated with color changing ink and shoes that activate color
changes. Each step a visitor makes results in a dynamic print that
slowly fades away.

The indoor shoes have custom soles attached with Velcro. The soles have
an embedded LED array that operate in near UV wavelengths. The LED array
is activated when a step is detected by the build-in accelerometer and
pressure sensor.

The floor is painted with a mono-stable light activated ink that
temporarily turns dark purple under UV radiation. The shoes activate a
color change that stays long enough to create playful patterns.
