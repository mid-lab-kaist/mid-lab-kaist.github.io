title: Calm Automaton
short: A toolkit for making personal, shape changing displays that gently display information in the periphery.
long: We introduce Calm Automaton, a customizable and programmable physical display that gently visualizes abstract data in a pleasing and meaningful way, without attracting attention. We extend the concept of calm technology with a DIY toolkit to make information and notifications comfortable, personal, and embedded in the periphery.

The abundance of information technology in today’s society results in
“Alert Fatigue” due to the overwhelming number of alarms and
notifications that attempt to grab our attention.

We introduce Calm Automaton, a customizable and programmable physical
display that gently visualizes abstract data in a pleasing and
meaningful way, without attracting attention. We extend the concept of
calm technology with a DIY toolkit to make information and notifications
comfortable, personal, and embedded in the periphery.

   :alt: The automaton design Process: 1) Attach artwork, 2) animate states, and 3) put to use.

The design process to make a personal display consists of two steps.
First make a design, select motion modules and attach artwork. Then
animate the modules by mapping states (e.g. sunny, clouded, rain) to
positions.

We designed 6 motion modules. Each automaton can house three modules.

We describe the design and implementation of the motion modules that
make the automaton and report on the experience of people using these
displays.
