This tutorial explains in seven steps how to make silicon moulds with a 3D printer. We take a foldable silicon cup as an example. For the tutorial you need a 3D printer, CAD software to make 3D models and silicon rubber. 

Step 1. Make 3D digital mold designs using CAD
----------------------------------------------

The mold design consists of two parts that enclose a cavity for the silicon and are connected at the bottom. On the top there is an opening for pouring the silicon. Make sure that the two shape can be assembled and avoid undercuts. 


Make sure that the two parts of the mold can be firmly aligned to ensure a consistent wall thickness. This is especially the case when you vary the wall thickness to make thin regions so that the silicon will bend. In the figure below we added a support structure, small ribs, to the inner part of the mold to center it.

Step 2. 3D print your parts
------------------------------

We print the parts with the Ultimaker 2 3D printer. Use PLA and not ABS, because ABS sticks to the silicon and makes it difficult to remove. Take care when you remove the parts to not cut your finger.

Step 3. Preparation of the silicon
--------------------------------

According to the instructions we precisely measure the silicon and hardener in a 1:10 proportion. We use the following silicon rubber and hardener:

Step 4. Mix the silicon
------------------------

Pour both components in one cup, and stir for a minute or so to get a uniform consistency.


Step 5. Pour the silicon into the 3D printed mold
-------------------------------------------

-   Pour Si properly in bottom pattern accurately covering the walls

-   Place the upper shape on the top

-   Finish filling

-   Adjust edges



Step 6. Wait for 24 hours
-----------------------------

Do not touch the mold for 24 hours

Step 7. Get the shape out of the mold

Tips and Tricks
--------------------------------------
Thinning of the edges is essential to make the cups squeeze. The animation below shows cups *without* thinning and they do not bend.

Different thickness of cup’s walls gives different elastic characteristics. In the animation below, the left mold has thickness of walls 1.5 mm, and the right mold has thickness of walls 3 mm.

In conclusion, thicker wall are more elastic and resilient and not even thickness of cup’s walls doesn’t give proper transforming (compression) characteristics, squeezing is better if wall thickness in the bend places is even.

It is easy to repair your silicone mold. In the places there your shape got torn put needed amount of prepared Si and let it stay another 24 hours.
