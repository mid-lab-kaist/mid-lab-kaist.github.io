Material Design Workshops makes use of the existing materials designer's have. Their collection of digitial materials and collections of material samples and example products. The tool Skin supports mapping materials onto product prototypes to make the interactions between shape and materials experiential.

Material Design Workshop consists of three steps. Prior to the workshop, materials are collected in the collecting step. In the generating step new ideas are generated. In the review step, an interactive wall display lets participants group their concepts.
