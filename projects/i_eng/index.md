I-Eng is an interactive toy aiming to teach new languages to young children between the ages of 3 - 5. The toy consists of a talking plush doll that interacts with tagged objects. The doll speaks sentences related to the objects that are nearby and, depending on the context, can ask the child for other related objects. In this way, both active and passive vocabulary are practiced. Through interaction with tangible objects, an unscripted narrative unfolds, resulting in natural exposure to the foreign language and a playful “learning by doing” experience. Using the accompanying storybook, caregivers can participate and aid in the learning process together with children.

Play is one of the main learning activities of children. We aim to expand second language exposure to children by introducing tangible language toys to support their language learning experience.
