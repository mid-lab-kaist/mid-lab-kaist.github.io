title: Interactive Training Chopsticks
short: Interactive training chopsticks that help children develop fine motor skills and eye-hand coordination that are needed for eating with chopsticks.
long: Handling chopsticks requires fine motor skills that are challenging to master. We present interactive training chopsticks that help children develop fine motor skills and eye-hand coordination that are needed for eating with chopsticks. We implement two games that use the chopsticks as a controller for an augmented mirror application to guide children through the required hours of repetitive practice in the process of learning chopsticks.

Handling chopsticks requires fine motor skills that are challenging to
master. We present interactive training chopsticks that help children
develop fine motor skills and eye-hand coordination that are needed for
eating with chopsticks. We implement two games that use the chopsticks
as a controller for an augmented mirror application to guide children
through the required hours of repetitive practice in the process of
learning chopsticks.

Various sensors are embedded in the interactive chopsticks to capture
user behavior by detecting number of actions : chopsticks touch food on
each of the sections of the plate; chopstick tips touch together; and
chopstick tips touch the userâ€™s mouth.
