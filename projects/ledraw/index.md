LEDraw uses long time exposure photography, which is similar to some traditional nighttime camp activities. However, these types of images are typically quite rough and mono color. By combining the <a href = "http://www.axidraw.com/" target = "_blank">Axidraw</a> and the LEDraw module, clean, multi-color images can easily be created by anyone, regardless of experience. The LEDraw module contains a depth controller and <a href = "https://www.adafruit.com/category/168" target = "_blank">Neopixels</a>, which are used for light drawing. The depth controller changes the depth of the Neopixel and is used for 3D drawing.
