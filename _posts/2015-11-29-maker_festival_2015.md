<a href = "../../../../projects/mirror/">Mirror Mirror</a> went back to Seoul for Maker Festival! Maker Festival is a part of Creative Korea 2015, a government funded exhibition for creative works.

A lot of people came to check out Mirror Mirror and had a chance to design their own t-shirts. Mirror Mirror was on display for all four days of the event.
