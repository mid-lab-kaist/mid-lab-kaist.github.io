We present a novel fabrication process to make Mandu's (Korean dumplings) in any shape. Based on a 3D model we generate custom tools designs, ready to be 3D printed. With the printed tools: stamps and jigs, users cut the dough and easily fold dumplings.

Food 3D printing is getting the spotlight by offering the opportunity to customize food appearances, textures and flavors that are troublesome to make by hand. Additive manufacturing machines extrude ingredients into a certain shape, however, they cannot be applied to all types of food, such as for Mandu (Korean dumpling).

We propose a novel and hybrid process in which we fabricate custom tools that assist the process of cooking. To assist in the mandu-making process, we present a stamp and jig system. Computer-aided design (CAD) software generates these tools based on the user’s parameters,
