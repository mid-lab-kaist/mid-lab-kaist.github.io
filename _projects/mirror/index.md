Magic mirrors superimpose virtual clothing over viewers’ mirror image to let them evaluate fashion items without actually wearing them.

We contribute the **Mirror Mirror** system that supports not only mixing and matching existing fashion items, but also lets users design new items in front of the mirror and export designs to fabrication devices.

Mirror Mirror makes use of spatial augmented reality and a mirror Virtual garments are visible both on the body for precise manipulation as well as in the reflection to obtain a third person perspective.

Designing with Mirror-Mirror is easy. Select brushes and artwork on the mirror surface and apply it directly on the body. A background image is projected behind the user to support evaluating designs in simulated environments such as office, forest or beach.

This novel, but seemingly complicated optical setup that combines a projector and mirror-TV results in a system that is easy to use and versatile due to the multiple “display” layers: on the body, on the mirror surface that shows the UI, on the reflected body and on the background behind the user. Thereby, allowing users to experience and evaluate designs in context.

Mirror Mirror reacts on the contemporary fast fashion trend of disposable clothing and anticipates the rise of personal fabrication technologies and possible futures of flexible color changing e-ink garments and sharing designs over the Internet.
