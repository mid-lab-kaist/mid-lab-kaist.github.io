Professor Saakes went to San Jose last week to present about <a href = "../../../../projects/mirror/">Mirror Mirror</a> at CHI 2016. The presentation room was completely filled up for the talk.

Mirror Mirror is an on-body t-shirt design system that utilizes a mirror and spatial augmented reality technology to enable users to design and visualize shirts before exporting the designs for fabrication. The presentation was about the design of the system and how it facilitates collaborative design activities.
