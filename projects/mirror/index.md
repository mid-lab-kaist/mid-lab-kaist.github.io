Magic mirrors superimpose virtual clothing over viewers’ mirror image to let them evaluate fashion items without actually wearing them. We contribute the mirror Mirror system that supports not only mixing and matching existing fashion items, but also lets users design new items in front of the mirror and export designs to fabrication devices. Mirror Mirror makes use of spatial augmented reality and a mirror Virtual garments are visible both on the body for precise manipulation as well as in the reflection to obtain a third person perspective. While much previous work deals with re-texturing and registering virtual garments to live user data, we focus on collaborative design and show various ways of designing using real bodies as mannequins.

We implemented a few ways of designing with graphics. By using mid-air gestures, users can manipulate graphics and edit properties of patterns, color, density and layering. The body also doubles as a canvas for drawing with a tracked brush and thanks to the in-place visualization, and unlike DressUp, users can be their own mannequins. Tracking hand position while drawing on the body proved to be unstable. Hence, we employ an IR reflective marker on a brush. Finally, an additional background image is projected behind the user to support evaluating designs in simulated environments such as office, forest or beach.

This novel, but seemingly complicated optical setup that combines a projector and mirror-TV results in a system that is easy to use and versatile due to the multiple “display” layers: on the body, on the mirror surface that shows the UI, on the reflected body and on the background behind the user. Thereby, allowing users to experience and evaluate designs in context.

Mirror Mirror reacts on the contemporary fast fashion trend of disposable clothing and anticipates the rise of personal fabrication technologies and possible futures of flexible color changing e-ink garments and sharing designs over the Internet.
