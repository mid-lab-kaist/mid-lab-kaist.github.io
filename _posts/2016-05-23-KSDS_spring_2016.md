Over the weekend Gary Ng, a masters student in the lab, and professor Saakes went to the Korea National University of Arts to participate in the KSDS Spring 2016 conference. Both of them presented at the conference.

Gary (pictured above) presented about a gesture based interface for remote inspection tasks with unmanned aerial vehicles. It was a small project detailing an interface we created that utilizes touch and in-air gestures to conduct surveillance and navigation tasks with camera systems. Professor Saakes (pictured below) was invited to talk at one of the tutorial sessions at the conference. He presented about effective prototyping in design research to a full and attentive crowd.
