The Computer Aided Design (ID219) class was tasked to create cardboard lamps using Rhino 3D and Autodesk 123D Make. The results of this project are 50 unique lamps that are currently on display in the foyer of the ID KAIST building until April 14th. Come out and see for yourselves the wonderful lamps at our building in N25!
