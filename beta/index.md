# Serial Displays

Fall 2013, Collaboration with [Alvaro Casinelli](http://www.k2.t.u-tokyo.ac.jp/members/alvaro/serialPaintings/). Back and Forth: anadrome pneumatique is the first work of the *Serial Paiting* series. These are serial displays and sculptures (2d or 3d) that alternatively encrypt and reveal visual information using unidimensional streams of matter. 

Current implementation consists of 6mm colored balls that roll in an spiral made of acrylic and measuring tape.
