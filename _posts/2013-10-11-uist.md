title: Paper presentation at UIST conference
---
We presented a paper at ACM UIST in St. Andrews in the U.K. regarding the efficients layouts for CNC fabrication. Although there are many sophisticated methods available for packing 2D shapes, oftentimes a human in the loop in required to sasify soft constraints, for instance, to make tradeoffs between aesthetics and reducing material waste. 

Our system "PACCAM" supports users making manual layouts and is specifically geared towards the occassional users in Fablabs.
