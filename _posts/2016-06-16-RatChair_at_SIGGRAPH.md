<a href = "../../../../projects/ratchair/">RatChair</a>, a project by our undergraduate student Tanya, got accepted to SIGGRAPH 2016 Emerging Technologies. RatChair is a strategy for displacing big objects by attaching relatively small vibration sources.

MyDesignLab will be showcasing the project at SIGGRAPH in Anaheim, California. SIGGRAPH 2016 Emerging Technologies is a showcase for state of the art human-computer interaction projects from a variety of different sub-disciplines.
