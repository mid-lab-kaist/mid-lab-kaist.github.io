myDesignLab went to Gangwon-do for HCI Korea 2016. Gyeol Han, one of our masters students, did a talk on the findings we got from user research done on the <a href = "../../../../projects/mirror/">Mirror Mirror</a> system.

The talk was titled "User Research for Experience of Fashion Design System Based on Spatial Augmented Reality" and was presented during the VR/AR I session. The presentation was very well received by the audience, with many members taking pictures, asking questions and wanting to know more about Mirror Mirror.
