# How to get to id KAIST

From **Incheon Airport**, buy ticket at counter and take a [bus](http://www.kaist.edu/html/en/kaist/kaist_01070705.html) then taxi.

**Gimpo Airport** has an infrequent [bus service](http://pem.kaist.ac.kr/to_Daejeon_from_Gimpo_International_Airport.pdf) to Daejeon which takes 3 hours; Better is to get the subway to Seoul station ( 30 minutes ) and then the [high speed train (KTX)](http://www.korail.com/en/rv/pr21100/w_pr21110.jsp) to Daejeon ( 50 minutes ). On Daejeon station get a taxi to Kaist ( 30 minutes ).
