How can we show our 16 megapixel photos from our latest trip on a
digital display? How can we create screens that are visible in direct
sunlight as well as complete darkness? How can we create large displays
that consume less than 2W of power? How can we create design tools for
digital decal application and intuitive-computer aided modeling?

The Slow Display is large size with an incredible high resolution but
updates at a very low frame rate. It uses lasers and monostable
light-reactive materials to provide programmable space-time resolution.

provides an approach to locate items with RF and a single radio that
does not require a prepared space with beacons or similar technology.
