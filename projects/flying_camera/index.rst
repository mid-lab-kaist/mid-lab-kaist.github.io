Navigating remote robots and providing awareness of the remote
environment is essential in many tele-operated tasks. An external view
on the remote robot, a birdâ€™s eye view, is thought to improve operator
performance.

We explore a novel designs for providing such a third-person view for a
ground vehicle using a dynamic, external camera mounted on a quadcopter.
Compared to earlier methods that use 3D reconstruction to create
third-person views, the benefit of our approach is a true third-person
view through a video feed. We so provide visually rich, live information
to the operator.

In an experiment simulating a search and rescue mission in a simplified
environment, we compared our proposed design to a pole-mounted camera
and to a traditional front-mounted camera. The third-person perspective
provided by our flying camera and pole-mounted camera resulted in fewer
collisions and more victims being located, compared to the front-mounted
camera.

Currently we present simple tethered flying cameras. Future work will
include balloon mounted camera for indoor scenarios and extended
functionality such as look around and scout.
