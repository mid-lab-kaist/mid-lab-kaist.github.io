Although many decisions in the home are made together, between partners
and within families, most digital applications for interior design are
geared towards single user operation. We present the results of a first
look into how couples design together and how that is different from how
professional designers collaborate in teams.

We developed a shelf design application, TwoShelves, that runs on
multiple and synchronized tablets and includes a projector that projects
the design real-time and real-scale in the living room.

We asked pairs of participants to design with the application using two
tablets in a single shared design space and using two tablets with both
private and shared design spaces. The initial results with three couples
in their homes reveal how they design together which might help future
design applications for at home.
