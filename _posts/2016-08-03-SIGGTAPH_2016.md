A team from our lab went to Anaheim, California last week to demo <a href = "../../../../projects/ratchair/">RatChair</a> at SIGGRAPH 2016. The prototype, a strategy for displacing big objects by attaching relatively small vibration sources, won the prestigious Digital Content Expo Prize and will be showcased in the Digital Content Expo held later this year in Tokyo.

RatChair is a project developed by the lab which enables furniture to learn to move itself using vibrations. After learning how several random bursts of vibration affect its pose, an optimization algorithm discovers the optimal sequence of vibration patterns required to (slowly, but surely) move the object to the specified position.

The Digital Content Expo (DC EXPO) is an international event focused on digital content technology. It showcases the future image of the digital content industry and is utilized as a place to exchange the latest information by researchers, creators and companies active in the industry. Each year, some of the best technologies are exhibited at the expo, which are chosen from all over the industry in order to showcase the most innovative technology.
