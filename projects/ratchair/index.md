RatChair a strategy for displacing big objects by attaching relatively small vibration sources. After learning how several random bursts of vibration affect its pose, an optimization algorithm discovers the optimal sequence of vibration patterns required to (slowly but surely) move the object to a specified position.

The white vibration modules can be attached to any object to make it move. They work together by coordinating their vibrations over WiFi. We also designed chairs with built-in vibration sources.
