<a href = "../../../../projects/tag_radar/">TagRadar</a> goes back to Japan! Felix, an undergraduate student who worked in the lab, was selected as one of the representatives of ID KAIST for Tokyo Design Week 2015.

TagRadar is a smart phone accessory that helps users to locate objects with radio frequency tags. It is an undergraduate graduation project that was made in collaboration with myDesignLab. Previously, TagRadar was shown off in Osaka at UbiComp 2015.
