![Lamps in Action](img/studiolab.jpg)

In 1973 Jim Hennessey and Victor Papanek published Nomadic Furniture a book filled with inspirational guides for end users to fabricate everyday furniture. Today, instead of using raw materials, we save time and skill by repurposing existing products such as those from IKEA. Big Lampan Lamps is an Ikea Hack for making a chandelier out of many small Ikea lamps.

The designs are based on platonic volumes to balance optimal lamp/sphere packing with ease of manufacturing. The cube consists of six lamps, no. 12 has twelve lamps on the faces of a dodecahedron. No. 32 has a lamp on each face of a truncated icosahedron.

Instructions are posted on the [instructables](http://www.instructables.com/id/Big-lamps-from-Ikea-lampan-lamps./) website. Lamps are connected with tie-wraps and all the wires are connected to a single plug.

A DIY kit for the no.6 that contains the manual, the template and the fasteners. Just add 6 lamps. A token of appreciation given to new subscribers of the bright magazine

![92 lamps version](img/no92.jpg)

The biggest and the baddest lamp is no 92. Larger it cannot get, because the base of a lampan is smaller than itâ€™s shade. The total diameter of no. 92 is only 140 cm by approximation. Made in Delft with Aadjan van der Helm and Walter Aprile.
