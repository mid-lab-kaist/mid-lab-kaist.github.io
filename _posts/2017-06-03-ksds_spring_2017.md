On Saturday 3rd, members of our lab traveled to the 선신여대 in Seoul to present work about the electronic mailbox, Doori Noori at KSDS Spring 2017.

[Doori Noori](/projects/doori_noori) is meant to emotionally connect parents and their preschoolers by allowing the transfer of postcards with photographs between their preschoolers at preschool and them parents at work.
