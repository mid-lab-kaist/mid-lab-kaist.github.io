Professor Saakes and our PhD student, Bokyung Lee, went to Australia to do a presentation and a panel talk for IASDR 2015.

Bokyung Lee did her presentation on <a href = "../../../../projects/user_review_analysis">big data in design</a>. Her talked went over some of her work dealing with extracting meaningful data from reviews from online retailers, such as Amazon, to provide product designers with a better understanding of customer needs. 

Professor Saakes was invited to join the Blending Design Research and Practice panel at the conference. As one of the five invited panelists, he gave a talk on his thoughts on design.
