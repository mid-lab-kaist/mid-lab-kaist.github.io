title: Start of the My Design Lab KAIST

Today is the first day of My Design Lab in the department of Industrial Design at KAIST in the republic of Korea.
We look at users as the designers of their own life. We innovate in open design, physical design tools, custom design as service and local manufacturing using digital fabrication.
