Professor Saakes' Computer Aided Design (ID219) class was tasked to create cardboard lamps using Rhino 3D and Autodesk 123D Make. The results of this project are 50 unique and interesting lamps that are currently on display in the foyer of the ID KAIST building until April 14th. 

The atmosphere was energetic as the students cheered at each of the lamps as they were being turned on. Professor Saakes even gave the students ice cream as they walked around and voted for which lamps they thought were the best. Come out and see for yourselves the wonderful lamps at our building in N25!
