Magic mirrors superimpose virtual clothing over viewers’ mirror image to
let them evaluate fashion items without actually wearing them.

We contribute the **Mirror Mirror** system that supports not only mixing
and matching existing fashion items, but also lets users design new
items in front of the mirror and export designs to fabrication devices.

Mirror Mirror makes use of spatial augmented reality and a mirror
Virtual garments are visible both on the body for precise manipulation
as well as in the reflection to obtain a third person perspective.

Designing with Mirror-Mirror is easy. Select brushes and artwork on the
mirror surface and apply it directly on the body. A background image is
projected behind the user to support evaluating designs in simulated
environments such as office, forest or beach.

This novel, but seemingly complicated optical setup that combines a
projector and mirror-TV results in a system that is easy to use and
versatile due to the multiple “display” layers: on the body, on the
mirror surface that shows the UI, on the reflected body and on the
background behind the user. Thereby, allowing users to experience and
evaluate designs in context.

Mirror Mirror reacts on the contemporary fast fashion trend of
disposable clothing and anticipates the rise of personal fabrication
technologies and possible futures of flexible color changing e-ink
garments and sharing designs over the Internet.
