The abundance of information technology in today’s society results in “Alert Fatigue” due to the overwhelming number of alarms and notifications that attempt to grab our attention.

We introduce Calm Automaton, a customizable and programmable physical display that gently visualizes abstract data in a pleasing and meaningful way, without attracting attention. We extend the concept of calm technology with a DIY toolkit to make information and notifications comfortable, personal, and embedded in the periphery.
