myDesignLab was at Maker Faire Seoul 2015 to demonstrate gesture controlled moving furnature.
Despite the chilly and rainy weather, a lot of people came out to check out this year's Maker Faire. Many people were impressed with the gestured moving furnature display that we had, with a lot of interest shown to our initial prototypes, the BrushBots, that we also had for show.
