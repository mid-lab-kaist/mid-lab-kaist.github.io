Research shows that design factors of packaging and food containers can
have a strong impact on taste experience and product evaluation.
However, so far research has mainly focused on how visual appearances
steer sensory impressions including smell and taste.

Taking into account new (technological) developments in packaging
design, this research investigates the impact of 3D-printed surfaces on
taste evaluation of two ice cream variants. In addition, the interplay
between surface textures and matching or non-matching shapes presented
on a poster in the consumption environment (i.e., an ice-cream salon)
was studied. To this end, 3D-printed cups with either a sharp or smooth
surface were manufactured and used in a taste session conducted at an
ice-cream salon, where either a poster with sharp or smooth shapes was
hanging down the wall.

Results testify to the potential of influencing taste evaluations by
means of surface textures, with a smooth surface enhancing sweetness
evaluation, and a sharp surface enhancing intensity evaluations.
Furthermore, findings might imply that mismatches between surface
textures and poster design may enhance product and taste liking.
