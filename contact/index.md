To reach KAIST by subway, get off at *>Wolpyeong Station (월평역)* and take exit 3. Walk straight and you will cross two rivers. After crossing the second river (near Home Plus), turn right and after a five minute walk you will reach the KAIST main gate on your left. Alternatively, there is also a [shuttle](http://www.kaist.edu/html/en/kaist/kaist_010701.html) bus that runs on weekdays.

KAIST can also be reached by bus. The *KAIST Bus Stop (한국과학기술원)* is right in front of the main gate and is serviced by buses 104, 121 and 604.

For more detailed instructions on getting to *Daejeon from Seoul*, please refer to [directions pdf](myDesignLab_Directions.pdf).
