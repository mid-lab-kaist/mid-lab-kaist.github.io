TagRadar is a smart phone accessory that helps users to
locate objects with radio frequency tags. We employ a
directional antenna and combine signal strength readings
with headings obtained from the compass of the smart
phone. While scanning a space by waving the smart
phone, the aggregated data is presented on an on-screen
polar graph that dynamically reveals the most likely
heading of the target object. A user test showed that
users favor TagRadar and that it is both faster and has a
higher accuracy compared to using only signal strength.

Tracking and locating objects is important in many
situations. TagRadar provides an approach to locate items with RF
and a single radio that does not require a prepared space
with beacons or similar technology.
