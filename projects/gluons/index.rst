Latest hardware improvements on transceivers supporting Low Power Wide
Area Networks (LPWAN) make it feasible to connect small battery powered
devices hundred of meters apart.

We propose a physical computing paradigm fully exploiting this novel
technology. Spatial physical computing (SPC) leverages not only natural
manipulation typically used on TUI and construction kits but also
integrates the necessary deambulation (around a building or a city) in
the process of creating, testing and tuning a distributed smart
sensor/actuator network.

The overall system is a compound of (an unlimited) set of independent
data-processing nodes supporting an event-driven data-flow programming
scheme. We demonstrate in a few examples how such networks can be
deployed - spatially programmed - through intuitive physical actions,
and discuss the unique qualities and challenges of Spatial Physical
Computing.
