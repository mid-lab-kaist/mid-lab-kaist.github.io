Two of our projects, BodyMeter and TwoShelves, were accepted to NordiCHI 2016! <a href = "../../../../projects/bodymeter/">BodyMeter</a> is a user-centered approach where posing and acting is input for personalizing furniture in a virtual reality environment. <a href = "../../../../projects/twoshelves/">TwoShelves</a> is a shelf design application that runs on multiple and synchronized tablets and includes a projector that projects the design real-time and real-scale in the living room.

Members of our lab will be attending the conference in Gothenburg, Sweden next month.
