Elliot Woods from <a href = "http://www.kimchiandchips.com/">Kimchi and Chips</a> came to ID KAIST and held a workshop on the RULR Toolkit, a flexibile toolkit for calibrating spatial technologies such as cameras and projectors.

The workshop went over the basics of projection mapping and showed the participants how to use the toolkit to achieve desireable results.
